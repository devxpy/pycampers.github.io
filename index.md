__Hey there!__ Looks like you found us,

PyCampers is techno religion, which preaches the python programming language.

We need techno religions, because the old one's were never designed with technology in mind.  
Quite the oppsosite, really.

## Why Python?

> Python is the second best language for __everything__.

_And that's not a bad thing._

__It's absolutely Incredible.__  
You can `pip install` to do almost anything you want.   
(and it doens't take a millenia, looking at you `npm`)  

Humankind has yet to see a tool that has this kind of power.

We're just here to let everyone realise this fact, and hopefully, one day, make python the __first__ best language for everything.
